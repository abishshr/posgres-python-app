# Take home Steps

**Step 1:**
Using Python and SQL create a table for each file in `data/`, and load the data.

**Step 2:**
Create a modeled table that contains all persons that follow no teams and populate this table. Format your Python script such that running the file will create all tables from the first question and the modeled table from this question.

**Step 3:**
Write a Dockerfile that will run your code and add it to the docker-compose.

**Step 4:**
Write a `README.md` with instructions on how to run your code and responses to the **Discussion section**

**Discussion Section: Please add this to your README**

1. What ways can this be improved for a production environment?
2. How does your solution scale?
